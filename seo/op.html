The ATN ThOR-320-1x Thermal Weapon Sight utilizes a time-tested 320x240 microbolometer core, coupled with a high resolution OLED color Microdisplay Assembly that provides exceptional resolution and clarity. The result: a thermal imaging scope that delivers superior accuracy and precision. Fully waterproof and able to detect a human being at a range of up to 450 meters, the ATN ThOR Thermal Gun Sight is ideal for professional use, home security, and law enforcement.<br />
The ATN ThOR 1x Thermal Scope features a digital menu that gives you a variety of options and adjustments allowing you to customize your system. You can select a number of reticle options (4 standard) as well as choose a reticle color best suited for your specific application. No more black reticles on a black and white screen - the ATN ThOR Digital Thermal Scope features a color OLED display giving you a sharp color reticle every time. Or switch to full color mode and overlay it with either a black, green or red reticle depending on the conditions and the environment. The scope features a rear projected optical precision windage and elevation system. Ever have problems with a scope not being able to hold zero? The ThOR has no screws or springs that can create targeting errors. With all digital controls, the ThOR will NEVER allow your reticle to move off base.<br />
The ATN ThOR-320 320x240 1X provides amazing image quality through total darkness, fog, or smoke. Darkness, camouflage or bright lights will not affect the sensitivity of this ATN Thermal Imager. The E-Zoom function allows digital magnification that provides you with vivid and clear images that will help you to accurately sight your targets. No other product is comparable in value or price. The ATN ThOR 1x Scope functions equally well as a weapon scope or a handheld viewer. This scope is ideal for nighttime hunting, force protection, border patrol, police SWAT and special operations. And these units are priced like no other thermal scopes in their class - as much as half of what you would expect to pay! Once you experience ATN Digital Thermal, you may not want to use anything else again!
