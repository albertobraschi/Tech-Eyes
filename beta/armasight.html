<h3>Armasightâ€™s Developing Relations</h3>

<p>Maintaining and supporting relationships is important in all arenas for Armasight. None are more important than those that are for clients like the Armed Forces. The Vice President of Armasight has been charged specifically with the task of creating a relationship with the Department of Defense (DOD). This is in addition to any relationships already formed with existing military and commercial establishments.</p>

<p>Relationships outside of the armed forces focus more on commercial sales than to individuals. While many of these products can be used just as easily for hunting as they can for military and emergency responder uses, it is not the intention of Armasight to sell to individuals. Commercial retailers are more than welcome to purchase and resell items to the general public following any applicable laws that apply to the sale of such items.</p>
