<div id="glossary" style="text-align:justify;">
<p><h3><a>Automatic Brightness Control (ABC)</a></h3><p>
  An electronic feature that automatically reduces voltages to the micro channel plate to keep the image intensifier's brightness within optimal limits. It also helps protect the tubes automatic brightness control. The effect of this can be seen when rapidly changing from low-light to high-light conditions; the image gets brighter and then, after a momentary delay, suddenly dims to a constant level. This is an essential task for night vision and thermal imaging.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Auto-Gated Power Supply</a></h3><p>
  When the power supply is &quot;auto-gated,&quot; it means the system is turning itself on and off at a precise rapid rate. Combined with a thin film attached to the micro channel plate (an ion barrier) reduces blooming.  Blooming can be noticeably less on systems that have a thin film layer. Systems with thicker film layers can be perfectly acceptable depending on the end user's application. Deciding which night vision goggle is the right option should not be based solely on blooming. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Black Spots</a></h3><p>
  Black spots are common blemishes in the image intensifier of the night vision devise (NVD).  Black spots can also be dirt or debris between the lenses of the night vision goggles (NVG). Black spots that are in the image intensifier do not affect the performance or reliability of a night vision device. They are inherent in the manufacturing processes. Every vision image intensifier tube is different. The same value as diamonds, there are no two alike.  For more information see picture to the right. Another source of information for black spots would be in the how to buy night vision equipment. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Bright Spots</a></h3><p>
  These can be defects in the image produced by the night vision goggles (NVG). This problem is caused by a flaw in the film on the micro channel plate. A bright spot is a small, non-uniform, bright area that may flicker or appear consistent. Bright spots usually go away when the light is blocked out and are cosmetic blemishes that are signal induced.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Biocular </a></h3><p>
  Biocular is the viewing a single image source with both eyes (example: watching a television set).  The perspective is  essentially perceiving the same image with both eyes. The image is flat, two dimensions, and generally viewed from straight ahead. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Binocular </a></h3><p>
  Viewing a scene through two channels; i.e. One channel per eye. Binocular night vision goggles are two identical symmetrical telescopes placed side by side, lined in the same direction allowing the use of both eyes. The uses of binocular functions are common in night vision and thermal imaging. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Blooming</a></h3><p>
  Blooming is the loss of the entire night vision image, part of the vision image, or small parts of the vision image. This is due to the intensifier tube overloading by a bright light source.  Blooming also known as a &quot;halo&quot; effect. When the viewer sees a &quot;halo&quot; effect around visible light sources it is because such a bright light source came into the night vision device's view. The entire night vision scene or parts of it have become much brighter.  This is functions then causes &quot;whiting out&quot; of objects within the field of view. Blooming is more common in night vision Generation 0 and 1 devices. The lights in the image to the right would also be considered to be &quot;blooming&quot;. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Bright-Source Protection (BSP) - High-Light Cutoff </a></h3><p>
  Bright-Source Protection (BSP) is an electronic function that reduces the voltage to the photocathode. This happens when the night vision device is exposed to bright light sources such as room lights or car lights. Bright-Source Protections (BSP) protects the image tube from damage and enhances its life. However, it also has the effect of lowering resolution when functioning the night vision goggles. .<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Boresighting </a></h3><p>
  Boresighting is the alignment of a weapon aiming device to the bore of the weapon.  Boresighting means to line up the axis of a gun with its sights to another avionics.  For more information to help understand boresighting also see Zeroing. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>C-Mount </a></h3><p>
  C-Mount is a standard still video camera lens. The thread size for mounting to the body of a camera is usually 1/2&quot; or 3/4&quot; in diameter.  This is commonly found on digital cameras. The C-mount specification can have several dimensions associated with it. The available dimensions are employed by all C-Mount lens manufactures in order for any lens and camera to image properly. </p>
<p><h3><a>COMSPEC (Commercial Specification) </a></h3><p>
  The Commercial Specification (COMSPECA) is a term used to describe image tube quality, testing and inspection done by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Chicken Wire </a></h3><p>
  Chicken Wire is an irregular pattern of dark thin lines in the field of view either throughout the image area or in parts of the image area. Under the worst-case condition, these lines will form hexagonal or square wave-shape lines. This condition would make the night vision device impossible to see clearly. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Daylight Lens Cover </a></h3><p>
  The Daylight Lens Cover usually made of soft plastic or rubber. It has a pinhole that allows a small amount of light to enter the objective lens of a night vision device. This should be used for training purposes only.  The daylight lens cover is not recommended for an extended  time during the use of any night vision device. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Daylight Training Filter </a></h3><p>
  The Daylight Training Filter is a glass filter assembly designed to fit over the objective lens of a night vision device. The filter reduces light input to a safe (night-time) level. The filtering of light allows safe extended daytime use of the night vision device.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Diopter</a></h3><p>
  Diopter is the unit of measure used to define eye correction or the refractive power of a lens. Usually, adjustments to an optical eyepiece accommodate for differences in individual eyesight. Most ITT systems provide a +2 to -6 Diopter range for night vision devices. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Distortion</a></h3><p>
  There are two types of distortion found in night vision systems. One type is caused by the design of the optics, or image intensifier tube. This is called the classical optical distortion. The other type is associated with manufacturing flaws in the fiber optics used in the image intensifier tube.  <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Classical Optical Distortion</a></h3><p>
   Classical optical distortion occurs when the design of the optics or image intensifier tube causes straight lines at the edge of the field of view to curve inward or outward. This curving of straight lines at the edge will cause a square grid pattern to start to look like a pincushion or barrel. This distortion is the same for all systems with the same model number. Good optical design normally makes this distortion so low that the typical user will not see the curving of the lines.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Fiber Optics Manufacturing Distortions</a></h3><p>
  There are two types of Fiber Optics Manufacturing Distortions for night vision. Both types of fiber optics distortions are most significant to night vision devices. There is the S-distortion and shear distortion. <br /></p>
  <h3><a><em>S-Distortion </em></a></h3><p>results from the twisting operation in manufacturing fiber-optic inverters. Usually S-distortion is extremely small and is difficult to detect with the unaided eye.<br /></p>
  <h3><a><em>Shear Distortion</em></a></h3><p> can occur in any image tube that uses fiber-optic bundles for the phosphor screen. It appears as a cleavage or dislocation in a straight line viewed in the image area. This is as though the line were &quot;sheared&quot;.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Equivalent Background Illumination (EBI)</a></h3><p>
  This is the amount of light seen through a night vision device when an image tube is turned on; however no light is on the photocathode. EBI is affected by temperature; the warmer the night vision device, the brighter the background illumination. EBI is measured in Lumens per square centimeter (lm/cm2). The lower the value, the better the illumination. The EBI level determines the lowest light level at which an image can be detected. Below this light level, objects will be masked by the EBI.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Edge Glow</a></h3><p>
  There is a defect in the image area of the NVG. Edge glow is a bright area in the outer portion of the viewing area. This can be sometimes sparkling in the night vision device view. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Emission Point</a></h3><p>
  Emission Point is a steady or fluctuating pinpoint of bright light. This is in the image area that does not go away when all light is blocked from the objective lens. The position of an emission point within the field of view will not move. If an emission point disappears or is only faintly visible when viewing under brighter nighttime conditions, it is not indicative of a problem. If the emission point remains bright under all lighting conditions, the system needs to be repaired. Do not confuse an emission point with a point of light source in the scene being viewed.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Eye Relief</a></h3><p>
  Eye Relief is the distance a person's eyes must be from the last element of an eyepiece in order to achieve the optimal image area. This is a crucial point to remember when using night vision goggles or any thermal imaging device. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Field-of-View </a></h3><p>
  The Field-of-View is the diameter of the imaged area when viewed through an optic instrument. The Field of View is the area that a person can see. It is the things that a person can see in front of them and their peripheral vision. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Figure of Merit (FOM)</a></h3><p>
  Figure of Merit (FOM) is the image Intensification tube specification designation, calculated on line pair per mm x signal to noise. The Figure of Merit (FOM) is simply calculated by multiplying the resolution (how detailed the image is) by the signal to noise ratio (how well the tube makes an image in low light). This technology used in thermal and night time vision instruments as well as cameras. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Fixed-Pattern Noise (FPN)</a></h3><p>
  Fixed-Pattern Noise (FPN) is a faint hexagonal (honeycomb) pattern throughout the image area that most often occurs under high-light conditions. This pattern is inherent in the structure of the micro channel plate. This can be seen in virtually all Gen 2 and Gen 3 systems if the light level is high enough.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Footlambert(fL)</a></h3><p>
  Footlambert (fl) is a unit of brightness equal to one foot candle at a distance of one foot.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Gain</a></h3><p>
  Gain also called brightness or luminance gain. This is the number of times a night vision device amplifies light input. It is usually measured as tube gain and system gain. The tube gain is measured as the light output (in fL) divided by the light input (in fc). This figure usually expressed in values of tens of thousands. If a tube gain is pushed too high, the tube will be &quot;nosier&quot; and the signal-to-noise ration many go down. U.S. military Gen 3 image tubes operate at gains of between 20,000 and 45,000. On the other hand, system gain is measured as the light output (fL) divided by the light input (also fL) and is what the user actually sees. System gain is usually seen in the thousands. U.S. military systems operate at 2,000 to 3,000. In any night vision system, the tube gain is reduced by the system's lenses and is affected by the quality of the optics or any filters. Therefore, system gain is a more significant measurement to the user.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)</a></h3><p>
  Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is the semi-conductor material used in manufacturing the Gen 3 photocathode. GaAs photocathode&rsquo;s have an extremely high photosensitivity level. They are in the spectral region of about 450 to 950 nanometers (visible and near-infrared region).<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Generations</a></h3><p>
  There are two technologies that  are referenced as night vision; <h3><a><em>image intensification</em></a></h3><p> and <h3><a><em>thermal imaging.</em></a></h3><p> Because of the cost and the fact that image intensifier scenes are easier to interpret than thermal, the most widely used night vision aid in law enforcement is image intensification (l²) equipment. Thermal images show targets as black or white - depending upon temperature - making it more difficult to recognize objects. There have been four generations of l² devices. They are identified as Gen 0, Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3. Developmental laboratory work is on-going. The U.S. military may designate the resulting as Gen 4. However, no definition for Gen 4 presently exists.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Generation 0</a></h3><p>
  Generation O was the first night vision aid (also called Generation Zero or Gen 0). They were sniper scopes that came into use during World War II and the Korean conflict. These were not true image intensifiers, but rather image converters. These scopes required a source of invisible infrared (IR) light mounted on or near the device to illuminate the target area.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Generation 1</a></h3><p>
  The &quot;starlight scopes&quot; developed during the early 1960's for use in Vietnam. They were the first Generation (Gen 1) of image intensifier devices. In Gen 1 night vision units, three image intensifiers were connected in a series. The series made the units longer and heavier than future night vision units would be. Gen 1 equipment produced an image that was clear in the center of the field of view, but suffered from large optical distortion around the periphery. Gen 1 equipment was also subject to &quot;blooming&quot;. Most low-cost imported night vision units use Gen 1 technology. </p>
<h3><a>Generation 2</a></h3><p>
  The development of the micro channel plate, or MCP, was in the late 1960s. This brought on the second generation (Gen 2) in l² night vision. The MCP accelerated and multiplied electrons. This provided the gain previously supplied by coupling with three image intensifiers together (Gen 1). The introduction of the MCP significantly reduced size and weight for image intensifier tubes. This enabled the design of smaller night vision goggles and hand-held devices. The MCP also provided much more robust operation when bright lights entered the field of view. The Gen 2 tubes used the same tri-alkali photocathode as the Gen 1 devices. This generation was implemented to reflect the change in how the light was amplified (MCP versus three-stage coupling).<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Generation 3</a></h3><p>
  Third-generation (Gen 3) image intensifiers were developed in the mid-1970s and became available during the early 1980s. Gen 3 introduced two significant technological improvements. The first was the gallium arsenide (GaAs) photocathode. The second was the ion barrier coating to the micro channel plate. The GaAs photocathode increases the tube's sensitivity to light from the near-infrared range of the spectrum. It also enables it to function at greater detection distances and improves system performance under low-light conditions. Application of a metal-oxide ion barrier to the MCP increases the life of the image tube. The operational life of Gen 3 tubes is in excess of 10,000 hours. The operational life of Gen 2 tubes is only about 2,000 to 4,000 hours. This generation  implemented to reflect the change in the photocathode (tri-alkali replaced with GaAs).<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Gated Filmless Technology </a></h3><p>
  Gated filmless technology was created in 1998 but without the reliability required for military delivery. By removing the ion barrier film and &quot;gating&quot; the system power supply, the technology demonstrated substantial increases in target detection range and resolution. In the process, it was discovered by ITT that the same performance results could be achieved using a Generation 3 tube. The tube had to be with a thinner ion barrier film and an auto-gated power supply, without sacrificing reliability and life-span of the intensifier tube.  For more information see also: Myth vs. Fact: Generation 4 directly below. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>Myth vs. Fact: Generation 4</a></h3><p>
  Some say that generation (Gen) 4 is the most advanced night vision. This is not the case. To dispel this myth, let's start with the basics. There are four Generations of night vision; however, they are Gen 0-3, not Gen 1-4. Historically, the U.S. Army has defined each Generation of night vision. In the late 90's the Army did define Gen 4 as the removal of the ion barrier film creating a &quot;filmless&quot; tube. This new advancement was to reduce halos while increasing sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution, for overall improved performance. While performance was improved, the lack of an ion barrier in Gen 4 tubes led to high failure rates, ultimately leading the U.S. Army to recant the existence of Gen 4 definition. Recognizing the high failure rates of Gen 4 tubes, ITT chose to improve upon the existing Gen 3 technology and create a &quot;thin-filmed&quot; tube. By keeping the protective ion barrier, but significantly reducing its thickness, ITT was able to maintain the reliability of Gen 3 while—at the same time—delivering on the Army's performance requirements intended for Gen 4. This innovation resulted in the production of the Gen 3 thin-filmed tube, which is now the highest performing Gen 3 tube available.<br />
  An image intensifier protection feature incorporating a sensor, microprocessor and circuit breaker. This feature will turn the system off during periods of extreme bright light conditions.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Inter pupillary Adjustment </a></h3><p>
  Inter pupillary adjustment is the distance between the user's eyes (pupils) and the adjustment of binocular optics to adjust for differences in individuals. Improperly adjusted binoculars will display a scene that appears egg-shaped or as a reclining figure-8.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Inter pupillary Distance </a></h3><p>
  Inter pupillary distance is the distance between the user's pupils (eyeball center). The 95th percentile of US military personnel falls within the 55 to 72mm range of IPD.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>IR Illuminator </a></h3><p>
  Many nights vision devices incorporate a built-in infrared (IR) diode that emits invisible light or the illuminator can be mounted on to it as a separate component. IR light cannot be seen by the unaided eye; therefore, a night vision device is necessary to see this light. IR Illuminators provide supplemental infrared illumination of an appropriate wavelength, typically in a range of wavelengths (e.g. 730nm, 830nm, 920nm), and eliminate the variability of available ambient light, but also allow the observer to illuminate only areas of interest while eliminating shadows and enhancing image contrast.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>IR Laser </a></h3><p>
  IR Laser is a high-power device providing long-range illumination capabilities. Ranges of several thousand meters are common. Most are not eye-safe and restricted in use. Each IR laser should be marked with a warning label like the one shown here. Consult FDA CFR Title 21 for specific details and restrictions.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Image Intensification</a></h3><p>
   Collects and intensifies the available light in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The image intensification offers a clear, distinguishable image under low-light conditions.</p>
<p><h3><a>IR (Infrared)</a></h3><p>
  Infrared (IR) is the area outside the visible spectrum that cannot be seen by the human eye. This is an area between 700 nanometers and 1 millimeter. The visible spectrum is between 400 and 700 nanometers.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Lp/mm (Line Pairs per Millimeter)</a></h3><p>
  Line Pairs per Millimeter (Lp.mm) is units used to measure image intensifier resolution. This is usually determined from a 1951 U.S. Air Force Resolving Power Test Target. The target is a series of different-sized patterns composed of three horizontal and three vertical lines. A user must be able to distinguish all the horizontal and vertical lines and the spaces between them. Typically, the higher the line pair, the better the image resolution. Generation 3 tubes have a range of 64 - 72 lp/mm. The line pair measurement does not indicate the generation of the tube. Some Generation 2+ tubes measure 28-38 lp/mm, while a Generation 1+ tube may have a measure at 40 lp/mm.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Lumen</a></h3><p>
  Lumen denotes the photons perceptible by the human eye in one second.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Monocular </a></h3><p>
  Monocular is a single channel optical device.  For more information also see Night Vision Monocular. <br /></p>
  <h3><a>NATO-STANAG </a></h3><p>
  NATO-STANAG is the term for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Standard Agreement. This can be described as an international MILSPEC<br /></p>
  <h3><a>MA/W (Milliamps per Watt): </a></h3><p>
  Milliamps per watt is the measure of electrical current (MA) produced by a photocathode when exposed to a specified wavelength of light at a given radiant power (watt).<br /></p>
  <h3><a>MCP (Micro channel Plate): </a></h3><p>
  MCP Plate is a metal-coated glass disk that multiplies the electrons produced by the photocathode. An MCP is found only in Gen 2 or Gen 3 systems. MCPs eliminate the distortion characteristic of Gen 0 and Gen 1 systems. The number of holes (channels) in an MCP is a vital factor in determining resolution. ITT Industries' MCPs have 10.6 million holes or channels compared to the previous standard of 3.14 million.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Near-Infrared</a></h3><p>
  Near-Infrared is the shortest wavelengths of the infrared region, nominally 750 to 2,500 nanometers. For more information also see How Thermal Imaging and Infrared Technology Works.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Photocathode: </a></h3><p>
  The input surface of an image intensifier tube that absorbs light energy (photons) and in turn releases electrical energy (electrons) in the form of an image. The material used has a distinguishing characteristic of the different generations.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Photocathode Sensitivity: </a></h3><p>
  Photocathode sensitivity is a measure of how well the image intensifier tube converts light into an electronic signal so it can be amplified. The measuring units of photocathode sensitivity are micro-amps/lumen (µA/lm) or microamperes per lumen. This criterion specifies the number of electrons released by the Photocathode (PC). PC response is always measured in isolation with no amplification stage or ion barrier (film). Therefore, tube data sheets (which always carry this &ldquo;raw&rdquo; figure) do not reflect the fact that over 50% of those electrons are lost in the ion barrier. While for most latest 3rd generation image intensifiers the photo response is in the 1800 µA/lm (2000 µA/lm for the latest Omni VI Pinnacle tubes), the actual number is more like 900 µA/lm. </p>
<p><h3><a>Resolution </a></h3><p>
  Resolution is the ability of an image intensifier or night vision system to distinguish between objects close together. Image intensifier resolution is measured in line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm) while system resolution is measured in cycles per milliradian. For any particular night vision system, the image intensifier resolution will remain constant while the system resolution can be affected by altering the objective or eyepiece optics by adding magnification or relay lenses. Often the resolution in the same night vision device is remarkably different when measured at the centre of the image and the periphery of the image. This is especially beneficial for devices selected for a photograph or video where the entire image resolution is essential.  Resolution is measured in line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm).<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Reticle (Reticle Pattern)</a></h3><p>
  Reticle pattern is an adjustable aiming point or pattern (i.e. Crosshair) located within an optical weapon sight.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)</a></h3><p>
  Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the light signal reaching the eye divided by the perceived noise as seen by the eye. A tube's SNR determines the low-light-resolution of the image tube; therefore, the higher the SNR, the better the ability of the tube to resolve objects with good contrast under low-light conditions. SNR is directly related to the photocathode's sensitivity. It also accounts for phosphor efficiency and MCP operating voltage. This is what makes the SNR the best single indicator of an image intensifier's performance<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Scintillation</a></h3><p>
  Scintillation also known as electronic noise. This noise is a faint, random, and sparkling effect throughout the image area. Scintillation is a normal characteristic of micro channel plate image intensifiers. It is more pronounced under low-light-level conditions.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Screen</a></h3><p>
  Screen is the image tube output that produces the viewable image. Phosphor (P) is used on the inside surface of the screen to produce the glow, thus producing the picture. Different phosphors are used in image intensifier tubes, depending on the manufacturer and tube generation. P-20 phosphor is used in the systems offered in this catalogue.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Stereoscopic Night Vision</a></h3><p>
  Stereoscopic night vision is when two views or photographs are taken through one device. One view/photograph represents the left eye, and the other the right eye. When the two photographs are viewed in a stereoscopic apparatus, they combine to create a single image with depth and relief. Sometimes this gives two perspectives. However, it is usually not an issue because the object of focus is far enough away for the perspectives to blend into one.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>System Gain</a></h3><p>
  System gain is equal to tube gain minus losses induced by system components such as lenses, beam splitters and filters.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Variable Gain Control</a></h3><p>
  Variable Gain Control allows the user manually adjust the gain control (basically like a dim control) in varying light conditions. This feature sets the PVS-14 apart from other popular monocular that does not offer this feature.<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Weaver Mounting System</a></h3><p>
  <p>US weapon mounting system used for attaching sighting devices to weapons. A Weaver Rail is a weapon-unique notched metal rail designed to receive  mating throw-lever or Weaver Squeezer attached to the sighting device<br /></p>
  <h3><a>Zeroing </a></h3><p>
  A method of boresighting and aiming a device of a weapon while adjusting to compensate for projectile characteristics at known distances.<br /></p>
